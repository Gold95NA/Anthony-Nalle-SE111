    <p>My name is <em>Anthony Nalle</em>. I was born in Newport, RI on December 30th 1995. From there I moved to Fall River Massachusetts until I was 5 years old where I then moved back to Newport and stayed until just recently this past August I moved back to Fall River. I'm Married with 2 children. My wife's name is <b>Cheyenne Wheeler</b> and she is a Respiratory Therapist at Rhode Island Hospital. I have 2 boys, my eldest is 5 and is named <b>Levi</b> and I have a 6 month old named <b>Westyn</b>. Currently I'm working at <i>Job Lot</i> while attending classes here at <i>NEIT</i> and look forward to my future here and beyond.</p>

    <p>For elementary school I bounced around a bit. I attended Underwood Elementary School in Newport RI for Kindergarten. For first grade through to fourth grade I attended Sheffield Elementary School also in Newport. Lastly for fifth grade I attended Sullivan Elementary School in Newport after Sheffield closed down permenantly. For middle school I attended Thompson Middle School before fifth grade was added so I attended Thompson from sixth grade through to eighth grade. Finally, I attended Rogers High School where I graduated in 2012. As of now I'm studying to achieve my bachelors in software engineering here at NEIT and am enjoying the ride outside of some less the ideal circumstances during this second quarter.</p>

    <p>My main hobbie outside of the usual video games and t.v. is martial arts. I'm a second degree black belt in Shaolin Kempo Karate and have been studying the art for going on 20 years. Since having my kids I haven't been able to attend as much as I'd like and hardly at all the past 2 years but my dojo will always be my home away from home. Other then that I also enjoy skateboarding, rollerblading and snowboarding as far as sports. Outside of sports I enjoy binging anime and spending time with friends and family.</p>
