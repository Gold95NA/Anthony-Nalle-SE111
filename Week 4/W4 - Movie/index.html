                <p class="section-text">This is a website for the review of the anime <em>One Piece</em>. The show is about a group of pirates <u>the Straw Hats</u> who sale the sea looking for adventure and ultimately, to find the worlds greatest treasure, the <em>One Piece</em>. The <em>One Piece</em> is a treasure left by the first and only <b>pirate king</b> thus far <i>Gol D. Roger</i> and is actually a complete mystery. No one knows what this treaure actually is but the idea of the <b>pirate king's</b> long lost treasure is to good for any true pirate to ignore. <u>The Straw Hat's</u> crew consists of <i>Monkey D. Luffy</i>, their captain and a man who dreams of being the next <b>pirate king</b>, his first mate <i>Roronoa Zoro</i>, the navigator and cat burglar <i>Nami</i>, the marksman <i>Usopp</i>, the ships cook Black Leg <i>Vinsmoke Sanji</i>, the ships doctor raindeer <i>Tony Tony Chopper</i>, archeologist <i>Nico Robin</i>, shipwright and cyborg <i>Franky</i>, ship musician the Humming Swordsman <i>Brook</i> and fishman <i>Jinbei</i> helmsman and an ex warlord of the sea. In this world there are things called <b>Devil Fruit</b> that grant strange powers to the the person who eats them at the expense of their ability to swim. <i>Luffy</i> eat the <b>Gum Gum Fruit</b> which gave him the ability to strech his body as if it were rubber which he uses to great effect when protecting his friends. <u>The Straw Hats</u> may be a relatively new pirate crew but they are determined to find the <em>One Piece</em> and see <i>Luffy</i> become the <b>pirate king</b>.</p>
