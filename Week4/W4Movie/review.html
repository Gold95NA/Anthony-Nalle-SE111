                <p class="section-text"> For my review of <em>One Piece</em>, I would give this show an 8 out of 10. The show is great and when it gets going it really gets going. The only issue I could see someone possibly having with it early on is just the pacing. The show has over 1000 episodes as it stands today and doesn't really get moving in my opinion until the <i>Water 7</i> arc which is 8 seasons into the anime. That said, the early episodes are a joy in thier own right, but the stories author <i>Eiichiro Oda</i> is a master at world building and the stakes aren't really their until he's laid quite a bit of ground work.</p>
                
                <p class="section-text">The manga for this story has a much more ideal pacing and would probably be the recommended medium for a new comer to this story who wanted to catch up. Another issue is the older animation for the first 2/3 of the anime although this issue is also solved through reading the manga up until the 2 year time skip and is also getting remade currrently with updated animation. That being said, the animation even in its early episodes is still passable and hardly noticed once you've invested yourself in the plot and development of the core characters. <em>One Piece</em> is a great series and worth the admittedly, heavy investment to get into it.

                <ul>
                    <li><i>Luffy</i> recieved his signature straw hat from a pirate named <i>Shanks</i> he idolised growing up. <i>Shanks</i> also saved him from a sea king losing his arm in the process.</li>
                    <li>Their are 3 different types of <b>Devil Fruit</b> and they all grant different powers, these types are, <b>Paramecia</b>, <b>Zoan</b>, and <b>Logia</b>.</li>
                    <li>The world of <em>One Piece</em> is mostly water with only two relatively thin land masses running perpendicular along the sides. This is the reason <b>The Marines</b> are the main branch of <b>The World Government's</b> military and why piracy is so common.</li>
